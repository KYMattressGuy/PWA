    icon: "🛏️",
    sections: [
      { title: "Mattress Types", content: [
        { h: "Innerspring", b: "Traditional coil systems. Bonnell coils are hourglass-shaped and interconnected — affordable but transfer motion. Offset coils are similar but hinged for better contouring. Continuous wire uses a single wire for consistent support. Best for: guests wanting bounce, airflow, and a traditional feel." },
        { h: "Memory Foam", b: "Viscoelastic foam that conforms to body heat and pressure. Provides excellent pressure relief and motion isolation. Can sleep warm without cooling tech. Density matters: 3-4 lb/ft³ is entry-level, 5+ lb/ft³ is premium (like Tempur). Best for: side sleepers, pain sufferers, couples who don't want to disturb each other." },
        { h: "Hybrid", b: "Combines a pocketed coil base with foam comfort layers on top. Gets you the responsiveness and airflow of coils plus the contouring of foam. Usually 2-3 inches of foam over 6-8 inches of coils. Best for: almost everyone — it's the most versatile construction type." },
        { h: "Latex", b: "Natural (Dunlop or Talalay) or synthetic rubber foam. Bouncy, responsive, naturally cooling, hypoallergenic, and extremely durable (15-20+ year lifespan). More expensive but lasts significantly longer. Best for: eco-conscious guests, hot sleepers, those wanting longevity." },
        { h: "All-Foam", b: "Multiple foam layers (poly, memory, gel) without any coils. Great motion isolation and pressure relief. Can be compressed and shipped in a box. Tends to sleep warmer without cooling layers. Best for: light sleepers, studio apartments, guest rooms." },
      ]},
      { title: "Firmness Scale", content: [
        { h: "The 1-10 Scale", b: "Industry standard: 1 = softest, 10 = firmest. Most mattresses sold are 5-7 (medium to medium-firm). The 'right' firmness depends on sleep position, body weight, and personal preference — not a universal rule." },
        { h: "Side Sleepers (4-6)", b: "Need softer surfaces to cushion shoulders and hips. Weight concentrates on smaller areas, so pressure relief is critical. Look for conforming foams or plush comfort layers over supportive cores." },
        { h: "Back Sleepers (5-7)", b: "Need balanced support — enough give for the lumbar curve but enough firmness to prevent hips sinking. Zoned support is ideal. Medium-firm is the sweet spot for most back sleepers." },
        { h: "Stomach Sleepers (6-8)", b: "Need firmer surfaces to prevent hips from sinking and creating a swayback. Too-soft mattresses cause lower back strain. Thin or no pillow pairs best with a firm mattress for stomach sleepers." },
        { h: "Combination Sleepers (5-7)", b: "Change positions throughout the night. Need responsive materials that adapt quickly — hybrids and latex work best. Memory foam can feel 'stuck' for restless sleepers." },
      ]},
      { title: "Key Technologies", content: [
        { h: "Pocketed Coils", b: "Each coil is individually wrapped in fabric so it moves independently. This means one side of the bed can compress without affecting the other. Coil count matters: 800+ for queen is standard, 1000+ is premium. Higher count = more precise contouring." },
        { h: "Zoned Support", b: "Different firmness zones across the mattress. Firmer in the center (lumbar/hips) and softer at head and feet. Prevents the heaviest part of the body from sinking and keeps the spine aligned. Key differentiator in mid-to-premium mattresses." },
        { h: "Cooling Technology", b: "Phase-change materials (PCM) absorb heat before you feel it. Gel infusions conduct heat away from the body. Open-cell foams allow airflow. Copper/graphite infusions add thermal conductivity. Always ask: 'Do you sleep hot?' — it's the #1 comfort complaint." },
        { h: "Edge Support", b: "Reinforced perimeter coils or foam encasement that prevents sagging when sitting or sleeping near the edge. Critical for couples who need the full sleeping surface. Also makes getting in and out of bed easier for older guests." },
      ]},
      { title: "Brand Quick Reference", content: [
        { h: "Tempur-Pedic", b: "THE premium memory foam brand. Proprietary TEMPUR material is denser and more responsive than competitors. Lines: Adapt (entry) → ProAdapt → LuxeAdapt (max pressure relief). Breeze line for cooling (ProBreeze = 3° cooler, LuxeBreeze = 8° cooler). 10-year warranty. Highest price point but strongest brand loyalty." },
        { h: "Sealy", b: "Posturepedic Technology = reinforced center-third support. Strong at mid-range pricing. Lines: Essentials → Performance → Posturepedic Plus. Innerspring heritage with modern hybrid options. Trusted name in mattresses since 1881." },
        { h: "Serta", b: "Perfect Sleeper and iComfort lines. Carbon fiber memory foam for cooling. Strong at mid-range. iComfort uses layered cooling systems. Perfect Sleeper addresses the 5 most common sleep problems (tossing/turning, back pain, sleeping hot, partner disturbance, mattress sag)." },
        { h: "Purple", b: "GelFlex Grid (Hyper-Elastic Polymer) is unlike any foam. Flexes under pressure points, supports everywhere else. Temperature neutral — doesn't trap heat like foam. Lines: Purple (entry) → Purple Plus → Purple Premier. Strong with younger demographics." },
        { h: "Beautyrest", b: "T3 Pocketed Coil® = three steel strands per coil for dynamic support. Beautyrest Black is the luxury tier with BlackICE™ cooling. Strong motion isolation from individually wrapped coils. Premium feel at mid-to-high price points." },
        { h: "Stearns & Foster", b: "The luxury/artisan brand. Hand-tufted construction. IntelliCoil® HD = coil-within-a-coil design. Premium materials (cashmere, silk, Tencel). Highest price tier. Sells on craftsmanship story and heirloom quality." },
        { h: "Helix", b: "Sleep Quiz-driven personalization. 6 models across firmness spectrum. Midnight = best seller (medium, side sleepers). Strong online brand moving into retail. Midnight Luxe is the premium tier. Appeals to research-driven buyers." },
        { h: "Somos Beds", b: "Sleep Outfitters' value-oriented brand. Premium materials at accessible prices. DTC-inspired value proposition in a retail setting. Great for guests who want quality without premium brand markup." },

  bases: {
    title: "Adjustable Base Pro",
    icon: "⚙️",
    sections: [
      { title: "Why Adjustable Bases", content: [
        { h: "The Health Case", b: "Head elevation: reduces snoring (opens airway), helps acid reflux (gravity keeps acid down), improves breathing for sleep apnea. Foot elevation: relieves lower back pressure (flexes hips), reduces leg swelling (improves circulation), helps restless legs. Zero-G: distributes weight evenly, simulates NASA's neutral body posture, reduces spinal pressure by up to 40%." },
        { h: "The Lifestyle Case", b: "Reading and tablet use without stacking pillows (proper neck support). TV watching with ergonomic back support. Working from bed with laptop (pandemic created this habit). Partner independence — split bases let each person customize. Under-bed lighting for nighttime bathroom trips. USB charging at arm's reach." },
        { h: "The Sales Case", b: "Adjustable bases add $500-$3,000+ to the ticket. Strong margins. Most guests qualify but don't know they want one — it's your job to demo it. The 'wow' moment when they feel Zero-G for the first time closes the sale. Attach rate goal: demo with every mattress customer." },
      ]},
      { title: "Key Positions & Uses", content: [
        { h: "Zero-Gravity (Zero-G)", b: "Head and knees slightly elevated. Simulates weightlessness. Takes stress off the spine and promotes circulation. Named after the position astronauts use during launch to distribute G-forces evenly. This is your #1 demo position — it creates an immediate 'wow' reaction." },
        { h: "Anti-Snore", b: "Head elevated 6-8 inches. Opens the airway by preventing the tongue and soft palate from collapsing backward. Can reduce or eliminate snoring for many people. Some smart bases auto-detect snoring and raise the head automatically (like Tempur-Ergo Smart)." },
        { h: "Lounge / TV", b: "Head elevated 30-45°, feet slightly raised. Perfect for watching TV, reading, scrolling phones. Eliminates the need for pillow-stacking, which creates terrible neck angles. Position the base as a lifestyle upgrade, not a medical device." },
        { h: "Flat", b: "Obviously, the base goes fully flat too. This is important to mention because some guests worry they'll HAVE to sleep elevated. Reassure them: 'You have every option — it's about choice, not obligation.'" },
      ]},
      { title: "Features to Know", content: [
        { h: "Wall-Hugging", b: "As the head raises, the base slides the mattress backward toward the wall. This keeps you close to your nightstand so you can always reach your phone, water, lamp, etc. Without it, you slide forward and away from everything. Major selling point." },
        { h: "Massage", b: "Built-in vibration motors (usually head and foot zones) with multiple intensity levels. Position it as a pre-sleep relaxation ritual, not a gimmick. 'It's like having a massage therapist help you wind down every night.' Usually 3-10 intensity levels with timer auto-off." },
        { h: "Smart Features", b: "Auto snore detection (raises head when snoring detected). App control from your phone. Sleep tracking integration. Preset positions (one-touch Zero-G, Anti-Snore, etc.). Under-bed lighting with motion activation. USB-A and USB-C ports. These are the premium differentiators." },
        { h: "Split vs. Single", b: "Split King = two Twin XL bases side by side, each with independent controls. ESSENTIAL for couples with different preferences. Same total width as a King. Requires two Twin XL mattresses instead of one King mattress. This is a significant upsell opportunity." },
      ]},
      { title: "Base Brand Reference", content: [
        { h: "Tempur-Ergo", b: "Premium tier: Ergo Smart Base has AI snore response, app control, preset positions, under-bed lighting, USB ports. Ergo Extend is the mid-tier with head/foot adjustment and massage. Ergo is the entry with basic head/foot. Best positioned with Tempur-Pedic mattresses but works with any compatible mattress." },
        { h: "Sealy Ease", b: "Purpose-built to pair with Posturepedic mattresses. Head and foot adjustment with wireless remote. Simple, reliable, competitively priced. Good mid-range option without premium smart features." },
        { h: "Purple Premium Smart Base", b: "Designed to pair with Purple mattresses. Zero-G preset, anti-snore, massage, USB ports, under-bed lighting. Voice control capable. Positioned as the complete Purple sleep system." },
        { h: "BaseLogic / Leggett & Platt", b: "Major base manufacturer behind many branded bases. Offer their own lines at various price points. Known for reliability and wide compatibility. Good for cross-brand pairing." },

  softgoods: {
    title: "Soft Goods Expert",
    icon: "🛡️",
    sections: [
      { title: "Mattress Protectors", content: [
        { h: "Why Protectors Are Non-Negotiable", b: "Stains can void the mattress warranty — even a small one. Body oils, sweat, and dead skin degrade foam over time. Dust mites feed on dead skin and thrive in unprotected mattresses. The average person sweats out 26 gallons per year in bed. A $50-100 protector safeguards a $1,000-5,000+ investment. Attachment rate target: 80-90%+." },
        { h: "Waterproof vs. Water-Resistant", b: "Waterproof: complete barrier, blocks all liquids. Uses a membrane (typically polyurethane) bonded to fabric. This is what you should always recommend. Water-resistant: slows liquid penetration but can soak through. Not reliable for warranty protection. Always clarify this difference — guests often assume all protectors are waterproof." },
        { h: "Cooling Protectors", b: "Use moisture-wicking fabrics (Tencel, bamboo) or phase-change materials on the sleep surface. Prevent the protector from trapping heat between the sleeper and the cooling mattress. Critical recommendation for anyone buying a cooling mattress — a cheap protector can negate the mattress's cooling technology." },
        { h: "Selling Language", b: "'This is like a phone case for your mattress.' 'It keeps your warranty valid.' 'Most guests choose it because one accident without it could cost you the entire mattress.' Never say 'add-on' — say 'part of the system' or 'included in most guests' packages.'" },
      ]},
      { title: "Pillows", content: [
        { h: "Pillow + Sleep Position Matching", b: "Side sleepers: HIGH loft (5-7 inches). Fills the gap between ear and mattress to keep the spine straight. Medium-firm to firm support. Back sleepers: MEDIUM loft (3-5 inches). Supports the natural cervical curve without pushing the head forward. Medium support. Stomach sleepers: LOW loft (2-3 inches) or no pillow. Prevents neck strain from turning to one side. Soft and thin." },
        { h: "Pillow Materials", b: "Memory foam: contours to head/neck shape, excellent support, can sleep warm. Shredded memory foam: adjustable loft (add/remove fill), better airflow. Latex: bouncy, responsive, naturally cooling, durable. Down/Down-alternative: soft, lightweight, squeezable. Low support — best for stomach sleepers. Cooling gel/phase-change: for hot sleepers who need temperature regulation." },
        { h: "The Pillow Conversation", b: "Ask EARLY: 'How old is your pillow?' (most people don't know — which means it's old). The fold test: fold it in half. If it doesn't spring back, it's dead. Demo on the mattress: 'Let me put this pillow under your head while you're on this mattress — feel the difference?' Connect it: 'A wrong pillow can undo everything this mattress does for your neck.'" },
        { h: "Tempur-Pedic Pillows", b: "TEMPUR-Cloud: micro-cushions of real TEMPUR material. Adaptive, soft feel. TEMPUR-Adapt: solid piece TEMPUR that precisely contours to head/neck. Multiple profiles (Pro Lo, Pro Mid, Pro Hi) for different sleep positions. TEMPUR-Breeze: cooling versions with Breeze° technology. Position as: 'Your mattress adapts to your body — your pillow should too. Same material.'" },
        { h: "Bedgear Pillows", b: "Performance-engineered approach — like athletic gear for sleep. Balance (back sleepers): medium loft, cradles the head. Align (side sleepers): high loft, fills the shoulder gap. Flow (stomach sleepers): low loft, thin profile. Dri-Tec® fabric wicks moisture. Air-X® ventilation panels. Position as: 'This is the pillow scientifically matched to how you sleep.'" },
      ]},
      { title: "Sheets & Bedding", content: [
        { h: "Thread Count Myths", b: "300-600 TC with quality fibers = sweet spot. Above 600, manufacturers use thinner, lower-quality threads or multi-ply tricks to inflate the number. A 400 TC Egyptian cotton sheet outperforms a 1000 TC microfiber every time. Teach guests: fiber quality matters more than thread count." },
        { h: "Fabric Types", b: "Cotton (Percale): crisp, cool, breathable. Gets softer with washing. Best for hot sleepers. Cotton (Sateen): silky, smooth, slight sheen. Warmer than percale. Best for those who want a luxury hotel feel. Bamboo/Tencel: naturally moisture-wicking, hypoallergenic, temperature regulating. Best for hot sleepers and sensitive skin. Microfiber: affordable, wrinkle-resistant, but traps heat. Budget option." },
        { h: "Deep Pocket Sizing", b: "Today's mattresses are 12-16+ inches deep. Standard sheets fit up to 12 inches. Deep pocket: 13-17 inches. Extra deep: 18-22 inches. If the sheet doesn't fit the mattress profile, it pops off — and the guest blames the mattress, not the sheets. ALWAYS match sheet pocket depth to mattress height." },
        { h: "Selling Sheets at Point of Sale", b: "Ask: 'What sheets are you using now? Standard sheets probably won't fit this mattress.' Connect to cooling: 'If you're buying a cooling mattress, you need sheets that breathe — not polyester that traps heat.' Frame as system: 'We've matched the mattress to your body. Let me match the sheets to the mattress.'" },
      ]},
      { title: "Warranties & Protection Plans", content: [
        { h: "Mattress Manufacturer Warranties", b: "Most major brands: 10-year limited warranty. Covers manufacturing defects (sagging beyond 1-1.5 inches, broken coils, foam deterioration). Does NOT cover: comfort preference, normal wear, stains. Key point: stains can void the warranty entirely — tie this back to the protector sale." },
        { h: "Extended Protection Plans", b: "Cover accidental damage beyond manufacturer warranty: spills, rips, tears, structural damage. Typically 5-10 year coverage. Cost is usually $99-299 depending on coverage level. Frame as: 'Insurance for your sleep investment' and 'Peace of mind for pennies per night.' Cost-per-night reframing: $200 protection ÷ 3,650 nights = $0.05/night." },
        { h: "Selling the Plan", b: "Don't ask 'Do you want protection?' — that invites 'no.' Instead: 'Most guests include the protection plan because it covers anything life throws at it for the next 10 years. It works out to about a nickel a night.' If they hesitate: 'If something goes wrong with your mattress in year 5, would you rather have coverage or a $2,000 problem?'" },

While you explore, is there a particular sleep issue that brought you in today?","We have a sale ending today, so now's a great time to buy.","Most people who say that end up buying. Let me show you our best seller."], a:1, tip:"Acknowledge their space, then pivot to discovery. Don't pressure or dismiss." },
    { obj:"This is way too expensive.", best:"I hear you. Let's break it down — at $0.55 a night over 10 years, it's less than a cup of coffee for the best sleep of your life.", opts:["You get what you pay for.","I hear you. At $0.55 a night over 10 years, it's less than coffee for the best sleep of your life.","We have cheaper options over here.","It's actually a great deal compared to other stores."], a:1, tip:"Reframe to cost-per-night. Never dismiss the concern or immediately downgrade." },
    { obj:"I can find this cheaper online.", best:"Great research! Online versions often have different specs. Plus you get expert fitting, delivery, setup, and old mattress removal here.", opts:["Online mattresses are garbage.","Great research! Online versions often have different specs. Plus you get expert fitting, delivery, setup, and removal here.","We'll price match any online retailer.","That's probably a knockoff version."], a:1, tip:"Don't trash online. Highlight what they CAN'T get online: fitting, service, hassle-free experience." },
    { obj:"I need to measure my room first.", best:"Smart thinking! I can note everything you like today with pricing, so when you're ready it's a quick visit. What size are you considering?", opts:["We have a tape measure here if you want to call someone.","Smart thinking! I can note everything with pricing so when you're ready it's quick. What size are you considering?","Most standard bedrooms fit a king no problem.","OK, we'll be here when you get back."], a:1, tip:"Validate, then keep them engaged. Document their preferences to make the return visit easy." },
    { obj:"Do you have anything on sale?", best:"Everything I show you today includes our current promotion. Let's find what fits your body first, then I'll make sure you get the best value.", opts:["Not right now, but our regular prices are fair.","Everything today includes our current promotion. Let's find what fits your body first, then the best value.","The clearance section is in the back corner.","We have a big sale starting next week, you should come back."], a:1, tip:"Redirect from price-first to fit-first. Everyone gets the current promo — lead with value, not discounts." },

Your body will tell you they're definitely not the same.", opts:["Your friend is wrong.","I used to think that too! Lie on this one, then this one.

Think of it as mattress insurance.", opts:["It's required for the warranty.","I get that! It does more than spills — blocks allergens and keeps your warranty valid.

    { obj:"I bought a mattress 3 years ago and it's already sagging. Why would I spend more?", best:"That's frustrating. Sagging usually means low-density foam.

You should've returned it.","That's frustrating. Sagging means low-density foam. These use high-density materials to prevent that. Let me show you.","Cheap mattresses do that.

Can I show you what makes THIS specific model different?", opts:["You can't trust online reviews.","I appreciate your homework. Reviews vary — different models and setups. Can I show you what makes THIS model different?","Which reviews? I bet they're about a different model.","Every brand has some bad reviews. Overall this brand is great."], a:1, tip:"Don't dismiss their research. Acknowledge it, then redirect to the specific product in front of them." },

Let me find you proper support that doesn't create pressure points.", opts:["Chiropractors aren't mattress experts.","Great you're working with a pro! 'Firm support' and 'firm feel' are different. Let me find proper support without pressure points.","Sure, our firmest model is over here.","A lot of people think they need firm but actually sleep better on medium."], a:1, tip:"Never contradict their doctor. Educate on the difference between support and surface feel." },

Let me personally make sure your delivery goes perfectly this time — I'll follow up day-of.", opts:["That was probably a different team, we've improved since then.","I'm sorry about that. Let me personally make sure delivery goes perfectly this time — I'll follow up day-of.","What happened? I'll file a complaint.","Our delivery service has gotten much better recently."], a:1, tip:"Own it, apologize, and offer personal accountability. Don't deflect or make excuses." },
    { obj:"I'll just buy a mattress topper instead of a new mattress.", best:"Toppers can help temporarily, but they can't fix worn-out support underneath. It's like putting new tires on a car with a broken axle. How old is your current mattress?", opts:["Toppers are a waste of money.","Toppers help temporarily but can't fix worn support underneath. It's like new tires on a broken axle. How old is yours?","That's actually a great short-term solution. Want me to show you some?","A topper costs $200 and a mattress costs $1000 — the mattress is a better investment."], a:1, tip:"Use an analogy they can relate to. Don't trash toppers — acknowledge the logic, then explain the limitation." },
    { obj:"I want the absolute cheapest thing you have.", best:"I respect your budget. Let me show you the best value in your range — and with financing at 0%, I might be able to get you into something that'll last twice as long for the same monthly cost.", opts:["Our cheapest mattress isn't very good, honestly.","I respect your budget. With 0% financing, I might get you into something lasting twice as long for the same monthly cost.","Cheapest is over there, but you'll be back in 2 years for a new one.","How much are you looking to spend? I can work within any budget."], a:1, tip:"Never shame the budget. Show how financing can unlock better value without increasing their monthly spend." },

Just 30 seconds — if you don't feel a difference, you win the argument. If you do... your spouse wins.", opts:["Your spouse is right, you probably need a new one.","Since you're here, try Zero-G for 30 seconds. If no difference, you win the argument. If you feel it... your spouse wins.","When was the last time you replaced it?

My price includes our current promo. Beyond price, I offer perfect fitting and service. What brought you in?","If you know the industry, you know this is already competitive.","I can't go any lower, this is the price."], a:1, tip:"Don't panic or discount. Acknowledge their knowledge, hold your value, and redirect to their actual need." },
    { obj:"I want to buy today but my credit score is bad and I don't think I'll get approved.", best:"Let's not assume — approval often surprises people. We have multiple financing partners with different criteria. Want to try a quick application? It won't affect your score to check.", opts:["We can try, but if your score is low it probably won't work.","Let's not assume — we have multiple financing partners. A quick application won't affect your score to check.","How bad is your score? Below 600 is tough.","We also take cash or debit if financing doesn't work out."], a:1, tip:"Never prejudge. Multiple lenders exist for a reason. Make the application feel safe and low-risk." },
    { obj:"Your competitor offered me 60% off. Can you beat that?", best:"60% off usually means the price was inflated first. Let me show you what you're actually getting here — materials, warranty, service — and you can decide which is the real better deal.", opts:["That's a fake sale and you know it.","60% off usually means inflated pricing. Let me show you what you're actually getting and you decide the real better deal.","We don't do sales gimmicks. Our price is our price.","I can offer you 20% off today only if you buy now."], a:1, tip:"Educate on manufactured urgency without insulting the competitor. Let the comparison sell itself." },
    { obj:"I've been sleeping on the floor and it's actually been great for my back. Why would I buy a mattress?", best:"If that's working, your body is telling you it needs firm support. A mattress with zoned support gives you that firmness where you need it PLUS pressure relief where you don't. Want to feel the difference?", opts:["That's really bad for you actually.","Your body wants firm support. Zoned support gives that firmness PLUS pressure relief. Want to feel the difference?","Whatever works for you! But a mattress is more comfortable long-term.","The floor doesn't have any give — you're probably damaging your joints."], a:1, tip:"Don't dismiss what's working. Explain WHY it works, then show how a mattress does it better." },
    { obj:"I'm buying for my rental property. I don't care about quality, just give me the cheapest thing that looks decent.", best:"Makes sense for the bottom line! But a returned guest costs more than a mattress upgrade. A mid-range mattress lasts longer, gets better reviews, and reduces replacement costs. Let me show you our best rental value.", opts:["Our cheapest queen is $299, right over here.","Makes sense! But a mid-range mattress gets better reviews, lasts longer, and reduces replacement costs. Best rental value?","You should still invest in quality — your guests deserve good sleep.","Rental properties actually need MORE durable mattresses because of heavy use."], a:1, tip:"Speak their language — ROI, guest reviews, replacement costs. Don't moralize about quality for quality's sake." },
    { obj:"I just got divorced and I'm starting over. I don't even know where to begin.", best:"Fresh start — let's make it a good one. This is actually a great opportunity to get exactly what YOUR body needs. No compromises. Tell me, how do you usually sleep?", opts:["Sorry to hear that. We have some affordable options for starting over.","Fresh start — let's make it great. Now you get exactly what YOUR body needs. No compromises. How do you usually sleep?","That's tough. Take your time and come back when you're ready.","Have you thought about what size you want? A lot of people downsize after divorce."], a:1, tip:"Reframe positively without being tone-deaf. This is about THEIR comfort now. Be empathetic but empowering." },
    { obj:"I have a medical condition and I'm worried nothing will work for me.", best:"I hear you, and I won't make any medical promises. What I can do is focus on exactly where you need support and pressure relief. We also have a comfort guarantee so there's no risk. What helps you feel most comfortable?", opts:["What's your condition? I might know the perfect mattress.","I won't make medical promises, but I'll focus on your support needs. Plus our comfort guarantee means no risk. What feels most comfortable?","A lot of our customers with medical issues love the Tempur-Pedic.","Have you talked to your doctor about what type of mattress to get?"], a:1, tip:"Never diagnose or promise. Focus on comfort mechanics and remove purchase risk with the guarantee." },
    { obj:"I'm a mattress reviewer and I'll post a negative review if you don't give me a discount.", best:"We'd love for you to try our products! We offer the same great experience to everyone. I'm confident that if I fit you properly, the review will write itself.", opts:["That sounds like a threat. I'll need to get my manager.","We'd love for you to try! We offer everyone the same great experience. Proper fitting means the review writes itself.","How many followers do you have?
